# Image Clustering using Mean Shift Algorithm

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the use of the Mean Shift clustering algorithm for image segmentation. Mean Shift is a non-parametric clustering algorithm widely used in computer vision tasks.

## Getting Started

This script requires several dependencies to be installed. Make sure you have Python, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and PIL installed. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn Pillow
```

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AHBRIJESH/Mean_Shift_Algorithm.git
cd Mean_Shift_Algorithm.git
```

## Usage

Run the notebook using Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This notebook loads an image from a URL, applies median blur, and then performs Mean Shift clustering. The clustered image is displayed using Matplotlib.

## Note

The code includes visualization steps using Matplotlib to show the original image, the image after median blur, and the final clustered result. Each step is shown using `plt.imshow()`.

Feel free to experiment with the code and explore the fascinating world of image clustering!

## Contribution

Contributions and suggestions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to enhance the functionality or documentation of this project.
